# http4k Examples Maintenance

This document tracks the maintenance tasks performed on the http4k examples repository.

## Tasks

### 1. Gradle Version Update (2025-04-27)
- Updated all 29 projects to use Gradle 8.13
- Created verification script `/Users/david/dev/http4k/examples/verify_projects.sh`
- All 29 projects successfully updated and verified

### 2. Kotlin Version Update (2025-04-27)
- Updated all regular projects to Kotlin 2.1.20
- Found one project using KSP: `/Users/david/dev/http4k/examples/http4k-connect/custom-api-client-and-fake`
- Updated KSP project to Kotlin 2.1.20 and KSP version 2.1.20-1.0.31
- Verified KSP processing works correctly in the updated project
- All projects now using Kotlin 2.1.20 and functioning correctly

### 3. Convert to Kotlin DSL (2025-04-27)
- Converted all Groovy DSL build scripts (21 files) to Kotlin DSL (build.gradle.kts)
- Used targeted manual conversion for each project type
- All projects have passing tests and verify successfully
- Handled special cases for different project types:
  - Basic library projects
  - Application projects with main class
  - Custom task configurations (e.g., Zip task for Lambda functions)
  - Special framework integration (Quarkus)
  - Shadow JAR plugin
  - Multi-project builds (react-app)

### 4. Convert Settings Files to Kotlin DSL (2025-04-27)
- Converted all 16 settings.gradle files to settings.gradle.kts
- Updated special cases like Quarkus plugin management
- All projects continue to function correctly with the new settings files
  
### 5. Convert to Multi-Module Gradle Project (2025-04-27)
- Created root build.gradle.kts with common configuration
- Created root settings.gradle.kts to include all subprojects
- Set up central gradle.properties file with shared version properties
- Established Gradle wrapper in the root directory
- Created a script to clean up individual project build files:
  - Removed redundant plugin version declarations
  - Removed duplicate repository declarations
  - Removed redundant task configurations
  - Maintained project-specific configurations
- Created a script to restore project-specific dependencies:
  - Preserved original dependencies from git history
  - Fixed special plugins like application, quarkus, shadow
  - Ensured proper use of shared version properties
  - Handled special cases for datastar modules not in git history
- Addressed various challenges in the multi-module conversion:
  - Fixed incorrect property reference formats (gradleProperties vs project.property)
  - Fixed special cases like Ktor's version catalog and Micronaut dependencies
  - Resolved syntax errors in build files that were breaking the build
  - Verified the build with successful tests

### Summary of improvements
- Standardized Gradle version to 8.13 across all projects
- Upgraded Kotlin version to 2.1.20 and related plugins
- Modernized build scripts with Kotlin DSL for better IDE support and type safety
- All changes verified with comprehensive checks
- Complete conversion to Kotlin DSL for all Gradle files (build and settings)
- Consolidated into a single multi-module Gradle project for simplified management
- Centralized version management in a single gradle.properties file
- Maintained documentation for future maintenance work

### Future Work
- Standardize remaining project configurations
- Consider upgrading other dependencies to latest versions
